RaModel                 Generate data (x, y) from various models in two
                        papers.
RaPlot                  Visualize the feature ranking results of a
                        fitted RaSE object.
RaRank                  Rank the features by selected percentages
                        provided by the output from 'RaScreen'.
RaScreen                Variable screening via RaSE.
Rase                    Construct the random subspace ensemble
                        classifier.

predict.RaSE            Predict the outcome of new observations based
                        on the estimated RaSE classifier (Tian, Y. and
                        Feng, Y., 2021).
predict.super_RaSE      Predict the outcome of new observations based
                        on the estimated super RaSE classifier (Zhu, J.
                        and Feng, Y., 2021).
